# ScratchNeuralNetwork

Julia package which builds neural network architectures from scratch.

Note that this repository is very much a sandbox and there is no guarantee anything runs; I'm simply using it for my own learning and exploration.

## Future work

There is currently only a small number of activation functions, derivatives, and loss functions included in this package. Coverage of algorithms is intended to be extended continuously as part of ongoing work.
